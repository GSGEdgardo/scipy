class GameOfLife:
    """
    Conway's Game of Life implementation.
    A Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton
    devised by John Conway in 1970.

    The game of life consist of a 2D grid of cells, each of which can be either
    alive or dead. There's a simple set of rules that determine the next state
    of the grid based on the current state. The rules are as follows:
    1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by
    under-population.
    2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
    generation.
    3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
    over-population.
    4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell,
    as if by reproduction.

    The game is played in generations, where each generation is a new state
    of the grid.
    The game ends when there are no live cells left or when the grid reaches a
    stable state.
    The class provides methods to evolve the game, print the current state,
    and count the population.
    The class also provides a method to create a new game from a list of lists.
    The class uses NumPy for efficient array manipulation and type checking.
